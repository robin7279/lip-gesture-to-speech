### **Lip Gesture to Speech Project**

# Lip Gesture to Speech: Enabling Communication for Verbally Impaired People

## Project Overview

This project aims to help verbally impaired individuals communicate by converting their lip gestures into synthesized speech in real-time. It uses deep learning models, specifically YOLOv8, for lip gesture detection and integrates text-to-speech synthesis to generate the spoken output. The system will be deployed on both mobile and web platforms for accessibility.

### Features
- **Lip Gesture Detection**: Uses YOLOv8 to detect lip gestures in real-time.
- **Text-to-Speech Synthesis**: Converts detected gestures into speech using text-to-speech engines.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Ensures smooth, real-time interaction for users.
- **Multi-Platform**: Integrated into both mobile apps (Flutter/React Native) and a web app (React.js).

### **Backend**:
- The backend uses **FastAPI** to create RESTful APIs.
- The backend is responsible for processing video frames, detecting lip gestures using the trained YOLOv8 model, and converting them into speech.

### **Frontend**:
- The **frontend** includes both web (React.js) and mobile (Flutter/React Native) applications that interact with the backend.
- The mobile app is designed to be lightweight and responsive, ensuring the system is accessible on smartphones.

### **Model**:
- The **YOLOv8 model** is used to detect lip gestures in real-time.
- The model is trained using a custom dataset of lip gestures and can be fine-tuned as needed.

### **Data**:
- The **data** folder contains both raw and processed datasets of lip gesture images/videos, with annotations for training the YOLOv8 model.

### **Notebooks**:
- The **notebooks** folder includes Jupyter Notebooks for model training, data preprocessing, and experimentation.

### **Deployment**:
- The **deployment** folder contains configuration files for Docker and Kubernetes to deploy the project to cloud servers.
